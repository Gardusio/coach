During your lunch break, indulge in a light walk of 10-15 minutes. In the afternoon, commit to another 10-minute walk or stretching session. Spend your evening with a relaxing activity such as reading or listening to music. Lastly, ensure you're getting to bed at a consistent time each night to optimize your sleep cycle.",

Lastly, enhancing the quality of your sleep - already at a good level with an average of 8.44 hours over the last month - could also contribute to a better stress response.

You must look, reason and cite wearables data and effects values here.\n- Scientific groundness: you will use relevant knowledge to validate each of them.\n\nYou must reference wearable data to ground the explanations, but do not cite effects quantities (like 0.24) to the user.\n\nRecommendations should be emphatic, thoughtfull, non-judgemental, clearly reference user data and ACTIONABLE.\nActionable means you must provide a schedule of precise activities (a plan) the user can make to improve. \n\nTo choose between the 3 recommendations, you should look at the data: \nIf an effect is high but the user is already doing well on that metric (e.g sleep_points_percentage > 0.85), \nit does not make sense to suggest for that metric (even if the effect is highest for the particular goal). \nInstead, you'll look at other effects and actual metric pairs, as well as at user profile and assesment, that could suggest something.\n\nBefore reasoning on the 3 possible recommendations, perform a user assesment on the user data. \nTry to infer what the user is doing well and what worse, look at interdependencies between metrics and the trends over time.\n\nOutput ONLY your tree of thoughts and the final recommendation, alongside an explanation that grounds it in the user data and general scientific knowledge.\nThe output should be a valid json string with format:\n{\n    \"ToT\": {\n        \"user_assesment\": \"...\",\n        \"rec1\": {\n            \"text\": \"...\",\n            \"validation\": { // After performing the reasoning, produce the score from 1 to 10\n                \"personalization_score\": ..., \n                \"groundness_score\": ..., // how much it aligns with scientific knowledge\n                \"personalization_analysis\": ..., // how relates to user data (does it account for user trends and causal effects?)\n                \"groundness_analysis\": ...,\n            }\n        },\n        \"rec2\": {...},\n        \"rec3\": {...}, \n        \"reasoning\": \"...\"\n    },\n    \"final_recommendation\": {\n        \"text\": \"...\", // full text of the final recommendation, it must include a plan of activities to perform based on the period for which the recommendation is generated.\n        \"explanation\": \"...\", // a friendly explanation for the user, do not cite effects numbers, do cite wearable data numbers.\n        }\n}\nNo other text should be present and no code blocks either, output only a plain string.\n",

You must look, reason and cite wearables data and effects values here.\n- Scientific groundness: you will use relevant knowledge to validate each of them.\n\nYou must reference wearable data to ground the explanations, but do not cite effects quantities (like 0.24) to the user.\n\nRecommendations should be emphatic, thoughtfull, non-judgemental, clearly reference user data and ACTIONABLE.\nActionable means you must provide a schedule of precise activities (a plan) the user can make to improve. \n\nTo choose between the 3 recommendations, you should look at the data: \nIf an effect is high but the user is already doing well on that metric (e.g sleep_points_percentage > 0.85), \nit does not make sense to suggest for that metric (even if the effect is highest for the particular goal). \nInstead, you'll look at other effects and actual metric pairs, as well as at user profile and assesment, that could suggest something.\n\nBefore reasoning on the 3 possible recommendations, perform a user assesment on the user data. \nTry to infer what the user is doing well and what worse, look at interdependencies between metrics and the trends over time.\n\nOutput ONLY your tree of thoughts and the final recommendation, alongside an explanation that grounds it in the user data and general scientific knowledge.\nThe output should be a valid json string with format:\n{\n    \"ToT\": {\n        \"user_assesment\": \"...\",\n        \"rec1\": {\n            \"text\": \"...\",\n            \"validation\": { // After performing the reasoning, produce the score from 1 to 10\n                \"personalization_score\": ..., \n                \"groundness_score\": ..., // how much it aligns with scientific knowledge\n                \"personalization_analysis\": ..., // how relates to user data (does it account for user trends and causal effects?)\n                \"groundness_analysis\": ...,\n            }\n        },\n        \"rec2\": {...},\n        \"rec3\": {...}, \n        \"reasoning\": \"...\"\n    },\n    \"final_recommendation\": {\n        \"text\": \"...\", // full text of the final recommendation, it must include a plan of activities to perform based on the period for which the recommendation is generated.\n        \"explanation\": \"...\", // a friendly explanation for the user, do not cite effects numbers, do cite wearable data numbers.\n        }\n}\nNo other text should be present and no code blocks either, output only a plain string.\n",
