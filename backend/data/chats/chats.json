In this case, we can focus on other areas that can help manage stress and maintain your wellbeing.\n\nConsider incorporating short mindfulness or relaxation exercises into your day. Even a few minutes of deep breathing or meditation can help reduce stress and improve resilience. Additionally, try to engage in light to moderate physical activity when you have the opportunity, like taking a brisk walk with your baby. This can boost your mood and help manage stress.\n\nRemember, it's important to be kind to yourself during this time and prioritize what works best for you and your new routine.
